        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>
            The App may display ads using third-party advertising networks such as Google AdMob.
            These partners may use identifiers, device information and usage data to show personalized or non-personalized ads,
            subject to your consent and applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may be able to manage ad personalization settings from your device settings or within the App (where available).
